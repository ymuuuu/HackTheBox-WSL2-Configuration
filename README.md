# HackTheBox-WSL2-Configuration
This guide explains how to connect to HackTheBox (HTB) servers using OpenVPN and WSL2, with specific considerations for users in Egypt.

---

## Prerequisites
1. **OpenVPN Community Edition**: Download and install the latest version (e.g., Version 2.6.13).
2. **HTB Configuration File**: Download your `.ovpn` configuration file from the HTB platform. Ensure you select the **TCP** version, not UDP.


## Steps to Configure OpenVPN with WSL2

### 1. Modify the Configuration File
Before importing the `.ovpn` file into OpenVPN, add the following line to the file:
```plaintext
windows-driver wintun
```
This ensures compatibility with WSL2.

### 2. Import and Run the Configuration
1. Open the OpenVPN application.
2. Import the modified `.ovpn` file.
3. Connect to the HTB server using the imported configuration.

### 3. Launch WSL2
Once the VPN connection is established, start your WSL2 terminal. You should now be able to access HTB servers directly from WSL2.



## Using UDP Instead of TCP
If you prefer to use the UDP configuration file instead of TCP, follow these additional steps:

1. **Run a Secondary VPN**: Before connecting to HTB via OpenVPN, start another VPN service (e.g., Kaspersky VPN, Cloudflare Warp, or Windscribe). This creates a "tunnel inside a tunnel" and bypasses restrictions.
2. **Connect to HTB**: Once the secondary VPN is active, connect to HTB using the UDP configuration file in OpenVPN.


## Notes for Egyptian Users
In Egypt, certain VPN protocols may be restricted. Using TCP or a secondary VPN (as described above) can help bypass these restrictions and ensure a stable connection to HTB servers.



By following these steps, you should be able to seamlessly connect to HackTheBox servers using OpenVPN and WSL2. Happy hacking!
